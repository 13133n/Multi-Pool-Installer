Setup is automated after the following questions are answered:

Question | Default | Help

Are you using a sub-domain as the main domain | no | If you plan to use something like pool.example.com
Install SSL | yes | Installs a 90 day cert from LetsEncrypt
Domain Name | localhost | Change to your domain either example.com or pool.example.com
Stratum Domain | stratum.domain.name | This should be something other then your domain name
Support Email | support@domain.name | Used to send you system alerts
Your Public IP | pulls ip last used to acess web server | To verify go to http://www.whatsmyip.org
DB Root Password | autogenerated 36 character password | Default mysql root password
DB Panel User Password | autogenerated 36 character password | Default mysql frontend password
DB Stratum Password | autogenerated 36 character password | Default mysql stratum password
Admin Portal Access Location | AdminPortal | to access example.com/site/AdminPortal

Installation will take about 25 minutes to fully complete. You will get a message on the screen letting you know it has finished. 

#### A server reboot is REQUIRED after the installer is completed to finalize the installation process!

After rebooting the server log back in to your user account. And you will be greeted by the following screen:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./.assets/first_reboot.png" alt="first_reboot"
       width="771" height="635">
</p>

#### On first reboot it may take up to 1 minute before the cron screens auto-start. After waiting one minute type:
```
motd
```
and you should see this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./.assets/running.png" alt="running"
       width="740" height="655">
</p>

#### To help make your server more secure we have changed the install locations and directory structure of YiiMP as follows:

Directory | Files
:--|:-:
/home/crypto-data/yiimp | General install location for YiiMP
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/starts | screens and stratum sh files - you do not need to run these
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site | -
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/backup | backup location for mysql DB
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/configuration | New location of your serverconfig.php
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/crons | New location of the `main:blocks:loop2` sh files
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/log | New location for debug.log and your nginx server log
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/stratum | New location for your stratum files
/home/crypto-data/yiimp/site/web | New location for YiiMP web files

Permissions have been setup correctly allowing your main user write acess to the /home/crypto-data directories! Changing file or directory permissions after install will cause your YiiMP to not function correctly, you have been warned!!

From there your YiiMP Single Server installation is fully completed. You can now go to example.com/site/AdminPortal to access your admin section and start adding your coins. 

#### üîó Commands

To view a screen type:
```
screen -r main|loop2|blocks|debug
```
To detach from a screen type:
```
ctrl+a+d
```
To start, stop or restart main|loop2|blocks|debug type:
```
screens start|stop|restart main|loop2|blocks|debug
```
We also suggest that you type:
```
yiimp
```
and get to know those commands as well!


## ü§ñ YiiMP Multi-Server Install

The YiiMP Multi-Server Install is recommended for those that want to run larger public pools. This offers the most security and is a lot more complex on the setup. 

The following two tables show you the perfered server setup for the multi-server setup:

Role | OS Version | Recommended Ram
:--|:--|:-:
Web Server | Ubuntu 16-18.04 | 2GB
DB & Stratum Server | Ubuntu 16-18.04 | 4GB
Daemon Server | Ubuntu 16.04 only | 8GB+ 
 
 or 
 
Role | OS Version | Recommended Ram
:--|:--|:-:
Web Server | Ubuntu 16-18.04 | 2GB
DB Server | Ubuntu 16-18.04 | 2GB
Stratum Server | Ubuntu 16-18.04 | 2GB
Daemon Server | Ubuntu 16.04 only | 8GB+ 

It is also highly recommended to use a provider that offers private IP's between your servers. If your provider only offers public IP's there is an option to install wireguard so that your servers use a secure VPN tunnel for the backend connections. 

#### Not using private IP's or installing wireguard is a major security risk and leaves your pool very vulnerable to attacks.

Installation for the multi-server setup <b>MUST</b> be completed in the following order:
 * DB Server or DB/Stratum Combination Server
 * Web Server
 * Stratum Server if not combined with DB Server
 * Daemon Server(s)

#### ‚úèÔ∏è After the completion of each server, you will be presented with the information that needs to be copied and then pasted when prompted during the next server install process.
